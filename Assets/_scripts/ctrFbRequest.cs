// Class responsible for Facebook Game Requests in Friend Smash!
//
// As Friend Smash is a social game that you play with friends, we need a way for players to invite their friends to play.
// With Game Requests, we can build a gameplay loop that allows players to challenge their friends to beat high scores,
// as well as sending invites to friends who aren't yet playing the game.
//
// For more details on Game Requests see: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/requests
